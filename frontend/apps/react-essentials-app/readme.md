## The Build Process (Theory)

1. React Code
    - the React code developers write
2. Build Process
    - changes & optimizes the code
    - transforms it such that it runs in the browser
    - also (potentially) optimizes other assets like CSS & image files
3. Deployable Files
    - a collection of generated files that include your optimized code and any other extra assets (eg. CSS code files, optimized images, etc.)
